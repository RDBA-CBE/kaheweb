    history: {

      content:
        "The NCC in India was formed with the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It was raised on 15 July 1948. The National Cadet Corps can be considered a successor of the University Officers Training Corps (UOTC) established by the British in 1942. During World War II, the UOTC never came up to the expectations set by the British. This led to the idea that some better schemes should be formed, which could train more young men in a better way, even during peace times. A committee headed by Pandit H.N. Kunzru recommended a cadet organization to be established in schools and colleges at a national level. The Governor-General accepted the National Cadet Corps Act, and on 15 July 1948, the National Cadet Corps came into existence.",
      wars_section:
        "During the 1965 and 1971 wars with Pakistan, NCC cadets were the second line of defense. They organized camps to assist the ordinance factories, supplied arms and ammunition to the front, and were used as patrol parties to capture the enemy paratroopers. The NCC cadets also worked for hand in hand with the Civil Defence authorities and actively took part in rescue work and traffic control. After the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars, the NCC syllabus was revised. Rather than just being the second line of defense, the NCC syllabus laid tremendous stress on developing leadership qualities and Officer-like qualities. The military training which the NCC cadets received was reduced, and greater importance was given to other areas like social service and youth-management.",
